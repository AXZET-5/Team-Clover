                        <p class="Center Content">My cca is string ensemble, and i play the violin! 🎻 I have a passion for music, so in my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and violin! Oftentimes, I also challenge myself to play tricky excerpts from various pieces, but usually fail 😬😬 </p>
                        
                        <p class="Center Content">I also enjoy watching F1! 🏎🏎 I really like the adrenaline that comes from the racing and it is really exciting to see the different drivers battle against each other in pursuit of victory!</p>
                        
                        <p class="Center Content">Hobbies aside, I think I am a friendly person, and I try to bring joy to those around me! 🤤 I also believe that I am hard-working, so if I do get voted into HCSC, I promise to give my all for the good of the school and you, the student body!</p>
