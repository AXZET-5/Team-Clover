                        I am kathryn khooL from 23s6a and i am running to be a part of YOUR student council 🍀🍀<br><br>
                        
                        here’s my short yet exciting journey to get to where i am right now:<br><br>
                        i was born on 5 september to a very funky family together with my twin sister kara<br><br>
                        
                        i spent 7 years in methodist girls primary and secondary school where i made many unforgettable memories 😢<br><br>
                        
                        i was in og 21 with whom i had an unforgettable orientation. my og mates were the ones who first introduced me to hwa chong’s vibrant colourful culture, which definitely inspired me to run for council!!🔥 <br><br>
                        
                        currently, i am in 23s6a with probably the best classmates i could ever ask for 🫶🫶<br><br>
                        
                        now, why would i ever want to run for council? that’s cause i want to take part in shaping our batch’s next two years in hwa chong. these are going to be long-lasting memories which i would love to play a part in organising. <br><br>
                        
                        truth be told, JC life is very short, which is why i want to make the most out of my time here by joining the 50th hwa chong student council. i hope to serve and guide YOU to make the most of these two years at hwa chong.</p>
